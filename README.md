# PIZZA-RESTAURANT-ANALYSIS-2024-TO-2026-USA

### üë®‚Äçüíª About the Project
As a Data Analyst Intern, I designed this Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize pizza sales across the United States between 2024 and 2025. The dashboard presents a comprehensive breakdown of sales performance, customer preferences, payment behavior, and delivery efficiency ‚Äî all critical for decision-making in the fast-paced food delivery sector.

### Key Insights
Top Performing Restaurants
Domino‚Äôs, Papa John‚Äôs, and Little Caesars were the top contributors by order count.

This suggests strong brand loyalty and widespread presence.

### Peak Days for Orders
Orders were consistently high across all days, especially on Fridays and Sundays, highlighting weekend pizza demand.

### City-Level Performance
Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Louisville topped the order counts.

These cities may benefit from targeted marketing or expanded delivery zones.

### Pizza Preferences
Medium-sized pizzas were the most popular (43% of orders), followed by Large.

Among types, Non-Veg, Cheese Burst, and Vegan pizzas had high traction.

Gluten-Free and Thin Crust options had lower order counts ‚Äî indicating niche but existing demand.

### Payment Insights
Majority of payments were made online (75%), with Card and UPI being the preferred modes.

Offline payments like Cash and loyalty-based systems (e.g., "Hut Points") were less utilized.

### Delivery Efficiency
The average delivery time was 29.49 minutes, while delayed deliveries averaged 18 minutes late, showing a need for optimization in peak hours.
